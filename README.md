## Overview

The DisTrack Endpoint Server collects coding session data from the DisTrack VSCode extension, including time spent coding, languages used, and Discord user IDs. This data is then accessible to the DisTrack Discord bot for generating user profiles and achievements.

## Features

- **Store Coding Session Data**: Records individual coding sessions with detailed metadata.
- **User Management**: Links Discord user IDs with coding session data.
- **Achievement Tracking**: Updates user achievements when coding milestones are reached.
- **Leaderboard with Trends**: Track rank changes over different timeframes (day, week, month, allTime).
- **Historical Snapshots**: Maintain historical leaderboard data for trend analysis.
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated snapshot taking for consistent trend tracking.
- **Session-Level Tracking**: Individual session records for accurate timeframe calculations.
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health checks and monitoring.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Live trend calculations based on actual session data.
- **Automated Data Cleanup**: Smart data retention system to prevent database bloat.
- **Data Aggregation**: Historical data preservation through intelligent aggregation.
- **Storage Optimization**: Automatic cleanup of old data while maintaining trends.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayNightmare/DisTrack-Endpoint-Server.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd DisTrack-Endpoint
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
     ```plaintext
     PORT=3000  # or any other port you'd like the server to run on
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_uri
     ```
   - Ensure the IP address of your server is whitelisted on MongoDB Atlas if using a cloud database.

2. **MongoDB Setup**:
   - Make sure MongoDB is installed and running.
   - Create a database for DisTrack (if not already done in the bot setup).

## Usage

1. **Start the Server**:
   - Run the following command to start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

2. **Test Trend System**:
   - Run the trend system test:
     ```bash
     npm run test-trends
     ```

3. **API Usage**:
   - The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:7071` by default.
   - Use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints.

4. **Trend Tracking Setup**:
   - Take initial snapshots: `POST /snapshots/all`
   - Set up scheduled jobs for regular snapshots (see `LEADERBOARD_TRENDS.md`)
   - Monitor system health: `GET /admin/snapshot/health`

   - Trigger manual cleanup: `POST /admin/cleanup`
   - Check cron job status: `GET /admin/cron/status`

For detailed information about the trend tracking system, see `LEADERBOARD_TRENDS.md`.

## Data Management

### Automated Cleanup

The server includes an intelligent data retention system that automatically manages database size:

- **üïõ Schedule**: Cleanup runs every Sunday at 02:00 UTC
- **üìä Monitoring**: Database statistics checked every Monday at 09:00 UTC
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Alerts**: Automatic warnings when storage exceeds 100MB

### Data Retention Policies

| Data Type | Retention Period | Action |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Coding Sessions** | 90 days | Aggregate then delete detailed records |
| **Daily Snapshots** | 30 days | Delete old snapshots |
| **Weekly Snapshots** | 6 months | Delete old snapshots |
| **Monthly Snapshots** | 2 years | Delete old snapshots |
| **All-Time Snapshots** | Forever | Never deleted |
| **Inactive Users** | 1 year | Archive (mark as archived) |

### Manual Cleanup

#### Trigger Cleanup via API:
```bash
# Full cleanup
curl -X POST http://localhost:7071/admin/cleanup \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get database statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:7071/admin/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

#### Trigger Cleanup via Code:
```javascript
// Manual cleanup
const result = await CronScheduler.triggerSnapshot('cleanup');

// Get database stats
const stats = await DataRetentionService.getDatabaseStats();
```

#### What Happens During Cleanup:
1. **Session Aggregation**: Old coding sessions are grouped by user/date and stored as aggregated records
2. **Snapshot Cleanup**: Old leaderboard snapshots are removed based on retention policies
3. **User Archiving**: Inactive users are marked as archived (not deleted)
4. **Statistics Update**: Database size and health metrics are recalculated

#### Benefits:
- **Preserved Trends**: Historical data is aggregated, not lost
- **Optimized Storage**: Database size stays manageable
- **Performance**: Faster queries with less data
- **Cost Effective**: Reduced storage costs for cloud deployments
     ```

2. **Testing with Postman**:
   - Use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or a similar tool to send POST requests to test the `/coding-session` and `/link` endpoints.
